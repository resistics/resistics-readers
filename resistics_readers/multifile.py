This module has utility functions to help when single recordings are split into
multiple data files.

In this scenario, it is possible for each data file to have specfic parameters
such as differing levels or scalings required to conver to field units.

Further, it is useful to check that the first and last times of each individual
file are continuous and without gaps.
